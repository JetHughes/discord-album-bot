# Discord Album bot
This a discord bot I created. Typing /album in server which this bot is added to will result in a link to a spotify album being send as a message to chat.

The albums are retrieved from 1001albumsgenerator.com API. The site is based on the book 1001 albums you must listen to before you die. 

# Current Issues
1) Currently there is no way to change which user to get the album from other than changing the source code.
2) The bot is currently not hosted anywhere
